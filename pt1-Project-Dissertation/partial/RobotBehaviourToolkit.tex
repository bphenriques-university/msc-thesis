\subsection{Robot Behaviour Toolkit}
\label{subsec:RobotBehaviourToolkit}

Huang et al. proposses a framwork that guides th generation of social behaviour for human like robots by sistematically using specifications of social beheavior from social sciences nado constectualizing these eespecitifications in a Activity-theroy based interaction model. THis framwroki as a open-source and available as a ROS module.


%The results show that specifications from this knowledge base enabled the Toolkit to achieve positive social, cognitive, and task outcomes, such as im- proved information recall, collaborative work, and perceptions of the

%[22] activity theory (fig 1)

Framework that guides the generation of social behaviour
Based on the activity theory [see 17, 22, 23 do paper Robot Behaviour toolkit]:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Activity Model
	\item Motives
	\item Participants
	\item Actions
	\item Outcomes
	\item Goals
	\item Operations
	\item Conditions
\end{itemize}

Composed of three subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Perceptual
	\item Cognitive composed of:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Context Generator
			\item World Manager
			\item Activity Manager
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
