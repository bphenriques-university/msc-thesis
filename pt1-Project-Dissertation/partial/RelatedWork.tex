\label{sec:StateOfTheArt}

Several virtual agents have been developed to study the impact of specific rapport strategies on the user perception of naturalness and social behaviour adequacy. The following sections describe the state-of-art in rapport and agents that are capable, at some extent, of managing rapport.

Section~\ref{sub:sec:ComputationalModelsOfRapport} describes current theoretical models for building rapport agents. Sections~\ref{sub:sec:rulebasedAgents}, \ref{sub:sec:datadrivenbasedAgents} describe virtual agents based on rules and \ac{ML} classifiers, respectively. Section~\ref{subsec:RestrictedPerceptionsWOZStudy} briefly describes current methodologies to learn social behaviours from \ac{WoZ} studies.

Lastly, Section~\ref{subsec:RelWorkDiscussion} discusses the current state-of-art and makes a brief comparison between the most important systems and their relevance and contribution to the proposed solution.
