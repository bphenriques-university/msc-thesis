\section{Background}
\label{sec:Background}

For the following sections, the main concepts of the document will be described. Section~\ref{subsec:Rapport} describes the concept of rapport since it is the main phenomenon we want to elicit on people's perception. Currently, researchers have been starting to use \acl{ML} approaches which Section~\ref{subsec:Rapport} describes. Lastly, Section~\ref{subsec:ReinforcementLearning} describes \acl{RL} \ac{ML} techniques, following current suggestions made by several researchers~\cite{Thomaz2006, Kok2012, Sequeira2016, Zhao2014, Papangelis2014}.
