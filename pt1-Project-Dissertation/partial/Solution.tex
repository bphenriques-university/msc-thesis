\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:Solution}

The current section describes the proposed solution that will address the development of a robotic rapport agent that improves current models for generating backchannels in dyadic interactions. Following current literature, the solution will inspire on the hybrid system described in Section~\ref{subsec:RestrictedPerceptionsWOZStudy}, on perceptual readings to refine \ac{ML} models described in Section~\ref{subsec:IterativePerceptualLearning}, on the \ac{WoZ} novel approach for training \ac{ML} classifiers described in Section~\ref{subsec:RestrictedPerceptionsWOZStudy}, and, to a lesser degree, current work on iterative systems capable of adjusting their current course of actions in real time~\cite{Kopp2007, Zwiers2011, Reidsma2011, Visser2014} (Section~\ref{sub:sec:ComputationalModelsOfRapport}).

Section~\ref{sub:sec:SERAFramework} briefly describes \ac{SERA} framework that is currently embed on several robotic agents and will support the proposed solution. Section~\ref{sub:sec:solution:arch} describes the rapport agent system architecture and Section~\ref{sub:sec:solution:WoZ} describes the proposed method to train the system in order to produce correct backchannels during the interactions.
