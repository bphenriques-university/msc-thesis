% The class "istulthesis" is based on the standard LaTeX 'report' class.
% It can be used for Instituto Superior Tecnico thesis, as it follows the 
% regulations published by the Scientific Council of IST.
% The class defines the document style. 
% IST requires the thesis to be written in Arial or similar. 
% Two arguments in '\documentclass' allow you to define the thesis font: 
% 'Helvetica' and 'AvantGarde', which transforms 
% the default LaTeX font into Helvetica or AvantGarde, respectively.
