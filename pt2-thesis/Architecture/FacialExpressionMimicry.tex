\subsection{Facial Expression Mimicry}
\label{sub:sec:FacialExpressionMimicry}

The Facial Expression Mimicry rapport \textit{Effector} mimics the user's emotion given the perceptual information returned from SHORE (the source code is available in listing~\ref{lst:facialExpressionsSourceCode} in Appendix C). The \textit{Effector}'s parameters (Table~\ref{table:facialMimicryParameters}) were attributed empirically following several pilots that were run with 3 different people until a balance was found between overeagerness and lack of liveness (Table~\ref{table:facialMimicryParametersValues}). In particular, the probability and the minimum delay specified in Table~\ref{table:facialMimicryParametersValues} were crucial to avoid triggering animations one, after another, for the duration of the emotion. In addition, the final \textit{Nutty Tracks} animation identifier is the base identifier followed by a random number between 1 and 5, for example, \textit{sadness1}, \textit{joy4}, and \textit{surprise3}. With this randomisation, the agent will not be as repetitive which may impact negatively the user's opinion of it. %Lastly, Anger is not specified as SHORE often mistakes it for happiness.

Nonetheless, the implementation of this plugin is not without issues as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In absence of faces, SHORE outputs happiness emotions with a high level of intensity ($>$ 75);
    \item There is a slight noticeable delay (less than 1 second) between the emotion appearing on the video feed and being transmitted to GRETA;
    \item Camera distance and light conditions have the greatest impact on accuracy.
\end{itemize}

The issues lied on a balance between accuracy and speed. Applying a smoothing filter solved the second issue by reducing the signal spikes but it increased the delay from at most 1 second to 3 seconds. In the end, we opted to remove the smoothing filter, compensating with enabling/disabling this plugin only when required in runtime (Section~\ref{sub:sec:effectorPlugin}). Finally, the last issue is easily solved by taking the lightning conditions into consideration when preparing the physical space.
