\subsection{Overall Discussion}
\label{subsec:RelWorkDiscussion}

Developing a computational models capable of managing rapport similarly to humans is not an easy feat. Researchers had to focus their research on different aspects of rapport and assess their overall contribution. Table~\ref{fig:comparison:rapportSystems} and Table~\ref{fig:comparison:vh:systems}, respectively, compares the systems regarding how they learn social behaviours, and the used rapport management strategies.

Current literature suggests continuing the research on learning social behaviours from \ac{WoZ}~\cite{Sequeira2016, Knox2014, Papangelis2014} studies and use primarily \ac{RL}~\cite{Thomaz2006, Kok2012, Zhao2014, Papangelis2014} classifiers (Section~\ref{subsec:ReinforcementLearning}). This class of algorithms are applicable in rapport as there are sequences of states that will help the agent to know when and how backchannels should be produced in order to build rapport (the reward function). In addition, authors suggest developing solutions capable of adapting current course of actions to the current context of the interaction to improve the quality of virtual agents during interactions~\cite{Kopp2007, Zwiers2011, Reidsma2011, Visser2014}.

Most of all, the communication goals of interactions must be considered when developing rapport agents. The context in which the communication partners will interact, the inherent limitations of the virtual agents' perceptions and actions and, most importantly, what kind of emotions and actions we want to elicit from the conversational partner are crucial for the development of such agents. For example, in tutoring applications, mutual gaze plays an important role for increased learning performance \cite{OTTESON1980, SHERWOOD1987, Fry1975}, and in negotiation scenarios not reciprocating negative self-disclosure has ben shown to destroy rapport\cite{Bronstein2012}.
