@article{Ekbal2008,
abstract = {Part of speech (POS) tagging is the task of labeling each word in a sentence with its appropriate syntactic category called part of speech. POS tagging is a very important preprocessing task for language processing activities. This paper reports about task of POS tagging for Bengali using support vector machine (SVM). The POS tagger has been developed using a tagset of 26 POS tags, defined for the Indian languages. The system makes use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of features that are helpful in predicting the various POS classes. The POS tagger has been trained, and tested with the 72,341, and 20 K wordforms, respectively. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed SVM based POS tagger with an accuracy of 86.84\%. Results show that the lexicon, named entity recognizer and different word suffixes are effective in handling the unknown word problems and improve the accuracy of the POS tagger significantly. Comparative evaluation results have demonstrated that this SVM based system outperforms the three existing systems based on the hidden markov model (HMM), maximum entropy (ME) and conditional random field (CRF).},

This paper describes a method for supervised training of a Part-of-Speech tagger using a committee of Support Vector Machines on a large corpus of annotated transcriptions of spoken Dutch. Special attention is paid to the decomposition of the large data set into parts for common, uncommon and unknown words. This does not only solve the space problems caused by the amount of data, it also improves the tagging time. The performance of the resulting tagger in terms of accuracy is 97.54%, which is quite good, where the speed of the tagger is reasonably good.}

@article{Graca2011,
abstract = {We consider the problem of fully unsupervised learning of grammatical (part-of-speech) cat- egories from unlabeled text. The standard maximum-likelihood hidden Markov model for this task performs poorly, because of its weak inductive bias and large model capacity. We address this problem by refining the model and modifying the learning objective to control its capacity via para- metric and non-parametric constraints. Our approach enforces word-category association sparsity, adds morphological and orthographic features, and eliminates hard-to-estimate parameters for rare words. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that is not much more computationally inten- sive than standard training. We also provide an open-source implementation of the algorithm. Our experiments on five diverse languages (Bulgarian, Danish, English, Portuguese, Spanish) achieve significant improvements compared with previous methods for the same task. 1.},

	Abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that focuses on the precise localization and subsequent classification of entities in a given text. Ambiguity pervades natural language, which makes this a rather challenging task. In order to provide a clear and reproducible classification of named entities (NEs), this document presents a set of delimitation and classification directives for the AMOUNT, HUMAN, LOCATION and DATUM categories in Portuguese texts.
This document is organized as follows: Sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 address the four main cate- gories: AMOUNT, HUMAN, LOCATION and DATUM, respectively. Section 9 addresses the metonymy problem and the methods used to solve it.},

@inproceedings{zhang2004optimality,
  abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning
	algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive
	performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional
	independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld
	applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the
	surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In
	this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification
	performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence
	distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes
	in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies
	of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification)
	or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role.
	Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes
	are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute
	evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We
	propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality
	of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes
	under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient
	condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence
	between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence
	among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore
	when naive Bayes works well.},
